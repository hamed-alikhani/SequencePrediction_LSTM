# SequencePrediction_LSTM
This project is designed to predict the most likely continuation of a sequence based on a given subset of the sequence.
Beam Search is used to improve the sequence prediction.
An innovative approach for LSTM evaluation based on Perplexity is developed to evaluate the model
# Model explanation
For a deteiled description of the model refer to the paper of Alikhani et al. (2020):
